# Segmenting Kidneys in MR Images for SIIM 2022 Turnkey Hands on

## SIIM Github Repo

### Task

In this tutorial we will explore implementing an automated segmentation method. The challenge is to create a method for performing segmentation of kidneys in MRI images of mice.  The data set consists of 150 axial MRI images from a variety of mouse models.  The kidneys were manually segmented and you will use these manual segmentations to develop your own deep learning model. You can read more about this data set in [Edwards et al. (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32828755/).

### Requirements

  1. Basic understanding of machine learning and deep learning

  2. Programming in Python

### Learning Objectives

  1. To train a deep learning segmentation model and learn the basics of keras
  
  2. To learn to interpret the results of training and validation
  
  3. To identify beneficial avenues for improving peformance.
